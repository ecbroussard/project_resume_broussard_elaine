# Resources

[Simple Expand JQuery Plugin](http://sylvain-hamel.github.io/simple-expand/)

This plugin allows for data to be collapsed and expanded, similar to the summary and details html5 tags. I used this feature to collapse and expand the details of each of my jobs.

[TwentyTwenty JQuery Plugin](http://zurb.com/playground/twentytwenty)

This plugin places a slider on two photographs and allows the user to slide back and forth between the two photos within the same space. I used this to incorporate two different pictures of me.

[JQuery .css() Documentation](http://api.jquery.com/css/#css2)
I used this site to help me write my custon JQuery code.

# Comments

Hi Richard! So I realize I'm turning this in a couple of hours late. This is my first slightly late assignment all semester, so maybe you could cut me some slack? This was a hellish week for me! If you're a really strict stickler, I understand, but I figure it doesn't hurt to ask. I have such a strong A right now, and it really sucks that I may have just screwed it up.
